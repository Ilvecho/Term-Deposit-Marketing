This project was a solution to the challenge faced by a startup providing machine learning solutions in the
banking sector
- Created a model which predicts the success of a telephone marketing campaign based on the data of the contacted person
- Performed preliminary analysis on the data to understand the underlying information available
- Peformed feature engineering on both continouos and categorical data to enhance the information availability
- Explored different options to deal with the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset
- Chose XGBoost as model, performed Randomized Search CV for hyperparameters tuning 
- Evaluated the model performance with 5-fold CV and hit the target performance level
- Used plotly for data visualization and pandas for feature engineering
